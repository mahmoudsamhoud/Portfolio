      <p class="post-text">
        HealthStat is a fictious consulting company that provides health care
        analytics as a service. In healthcare analytics, quality metrics are
        often classified across six domains:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Safety: Avoiding harm to patients from the care that is intended to
          help them.
        </li>
        <li>
          Effectiveness: How well a healthcare service achieves its intended
          purpose.
        </li>
        <li>
          Timeliness: Reducing delays for both those who receive and those who
          give care.
        </li>
        <li>
          Patient-Centered: Providing care that is respectful of and responsive
          to individual patient preferences, needs, and values.
        </li>
        <li>
          Equity: Providing care that does not vary in quality because of
          personal characteristics.
        </li>
        <li>
          Efficiency: Avoiding waste, including wase of equipment, supplies,
          ideas, and energy.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p class="post-text">
        The focus for this case study is <strong>efficiency</strong> domain.

      <h2 class="sub-heading">Measuring Hospital Efficiency</h2>
      <p class="post-text">
        Length of stay (LOS) is considered an important indicator of the
        efficiency of hospital management. It's calculated as the total duration
        in days for a patient stay in hospital. A shorter LOS is often desirable
        in hospital operations. Primarily, shorter LOS means costs can be
        lowered. Reducing LOS can also release capacity in the system and
        improve throughput, enabling hospitals to serve more patients. Many
        factors can impact LOS. Patient age, health status, the type of
        procedure (or surgery), whether or not there were any complications, and
        the size of the hospital are some common factors. For further
        information, you can read this

        In this case study, the focus is on patients who received hip
        replacement surgery (most of the data as shown in the figure below).
        Here's a bit of a background on what this procedure is all about.
        Patients with hip pain, typically arthritis, may require elective hip
        replacement surgery. In this procedure, damaged bone and cartilage is
        surgically removed and replaced with prosthetic components. Hospital
        stay can range from 0 to 2 or more days. For further information you can

      <p class="post-text">
        The dataset has some key attributes to analyze efficiency. Length of
        stay measured in total days Total costs attributed to each hospital
        stay. Here are some of the key attributes of interest for the case
        study. These include a unique identifier for facility (facility_id), a
        grouping of patient age (age_group), patient's disposition
        (patient_disposition), the diagnosis description
        (ccs_diagnosis_desposition), severity of illness
        (apr_severity_of_illness), and risk of mortality
        (apr_risk_of_mortality). We will closely evaluate these (and others) in
        the case study as we work to understand what factors impact length of
        stay and related costs.

      <p class="post-text">
        The data file was transformed and processed using Power BI to ensure
        data completeness and validity. The data was filtered to include only
        hip replacement surgery. New columns and measures were added to help
        with the analysis. Finally, the dashboard was created with Power BI
        based on the template provided to help stakeholders:
