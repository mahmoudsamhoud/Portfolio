        <h2 class="sub-heading">Measuring Hospital Efficiency</h2>
        <p class="post-text">
          Length of stay (LOS) is considered an important indicator of the
          efficiency of hospital management. It's calculated as the total
          duration in days for a patient stay in hospital. A shorter LOS is
          often desirable in hospital operations. Primarily, shorter LOS means
          costs can be lowered. Reducing LOS can also release capacity in the
          system and improve throughput, enabling hospitals to serve more
          patients. Many factors can impact LOS. Patient age, health status, the
          type of procedure (or surgery), whether or not there were any
          complications, and the size of the hospital are some common factors.

          In this case study, the focus is on patients who received hip
          replacement surgery (most of the data as shown in the figure below).
          Here's a bit of a background on what this procedure is all about.
          Patients with hip pain, typically arthritis, may require elective hip
          replacement surgery. In this procedure, damaged bone and cartilage is
          surgically removed and replaced with prosthetic components. Hospital
          stay can range from 0 to 2 or more days. For further information you

          The dataset has some key attributes to analyze efficiency. Length of

          stay. Here are some of the key attributes of interest for the case
          study. These include a unique identifier for facility (facility_id), a
          grouping of patient age (age_group), patient's disposition
          (patient_disposition), the diagnosis description
